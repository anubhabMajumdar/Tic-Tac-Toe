This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game where one plays against the computer.
The front end is written using Javascript and HTML while the backend is developed using php.
The game is unbeatable, i.e., the human player can either draw or lose the game.
The game logic uses depth first search and assigns weight to possible next moves.
Enjoy!
